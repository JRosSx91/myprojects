            <h2>Key Facts</h2>
            <p>Oskar Schindler was a German businessman and a member of the Nazi Party. In November 1939, he acquired
                some factories in German-occupied Poland by taking advantage of the German policy to "Aryanize" and
                "Germanize" Jewish-owned and Polish-owned businesses.</br></br> The best known of these factories today
                is the “Emalia” factory in Kraków. Before Schindler acquired this factory, it had been Jewish-owned. At
                Emalia, Schindler employed Jewish forced laborers from the Krakau-Plaszow camp.</br></br> By employing
                Jews and protecting them from the systematic brutality and arbitrary murder of daily life in a
                concentration camp, Schindler facilitated the survival of over 1,000 Jews. He was posthumously given the
                title "Righteous Among the Nations" in 1993.
